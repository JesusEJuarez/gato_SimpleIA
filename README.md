# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Introduction

In this project, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed for playing the popular game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as GATO. The GUI allows users to interact with the game by clicking on the grid squares of the game board. Additionally, an artificial intelligence has been implemented to automatically play against the user and has the capability to block the game and defeat the user when necessary.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.
- The computer uses AI for strategic decision-making.
- Intuitive graphical user interface.
- Clear implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe game rules.

## How to Play

1. Run the program and open the application.
2. Select "One Player" to play against the computer.
3. On your turn, click on an empty square to place your "X" token.
4. The computer ("O") will automatically make its move.
5. The game will continue until one player wins or there's a draw.

## Game Rules

The objective of the game is to place three tokens of the same type in a row, column, or diagonal. The first player to achieve this wins the game. If the board is filled, and no player manages to create a line of three, the game ends in a draw.

## Technical Notes

- The code uses the Tkinter library to create the graphical interface.
- The computer AI is based on strategies to block the human player and seek opportunities to win.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Execution

Run the program and follow the instructions in the graphical interface to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.
